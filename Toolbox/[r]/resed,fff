!ResEd is used to create all the windows and menus required for the program
as well as the Iconbar and InfoBox needed.

Your resource file can be tested with {*}!ResTest{*} which will open all windows
and menus in exactly the same way as your program should.  This is useful for testing your User Interface before actually having to code anything.
