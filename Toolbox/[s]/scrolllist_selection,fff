Purpose:	Event is raised when the user clicks SELECT or ADJUST on a scroll list gadget that is not faded. The type of mouse click is indicated by <flags=>scrolllist_selection_flags> bits 1 & 2. The relevant item number is included in the event data and <flags=>scrolllist_selection_flags> bit 0 indicates whether it was selected or deselected. Since <TextGadgets=>textgadgets/m> 0.78 the column number and click coordinates are also included; the presence of these fields is indicated by <flags=>scrolllist_selection_flags> bit 3.
	This event may also be raised (depending on flags) by methods   <ScrollList_DeleteItems>, <ScrollList_SelectItem> and <ScrollList_DeselectItem>. Before version 0.87 this event was generated by the latter two whether or not the selection had actually changed, and the item number quoted was incorrect.
