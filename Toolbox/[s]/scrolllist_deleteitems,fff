Purpose:	Method deletes items from a scroll list between the start and end positions specified by R4 and R5 (inclusive). To delete all items, set R4 to 0, and R5 to &FFFFFFFF. If bit 0 of R0 is set then a <ScrollList_Selection> event will be raised upon completion of this method; this will contain an item number of &FFFFFFFF and does not necessarily mean the selection has changed.
