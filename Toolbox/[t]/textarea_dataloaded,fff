Purpose:	Event is raised when text has been imported into a text area by the user (requires <TextGadgets=>TextGadgets/m> 0.38). Future versions of TextGadgets will include the start & end index of the imported text and set flags bit 0 to indicate paste from clipboard (not implemented as of version 0.92). Note the proposed data structure has changed since early versions of the C header.
